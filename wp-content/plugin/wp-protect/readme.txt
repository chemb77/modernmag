Protect your WordPress site against right clicks, text selection, and image dragging.

== Description ==

WP-Protect is a plugin for WordPress websites that allows webmasters to protect their content from being stolen. More specifically, it allows webmasters to disable right clicking abilities for their website visitors, along with a few other things like image dragging and text selection. These features are accomplished by way of javascript coding, so this plugin may not work for some visitors who have disabled javascript in their browser. While some webmasters feel that these types of scripts are pointless as "savvy" visitors can either disable javascript or "view source" in order to steal your content, we disagree for two reasons. Firstly, the vast majority of internet users are not aware of how to do either of these two things, and are usually the people who unwittingly go around stealing content without thinking twice about it. Secondly, "savvy" visitors will at least be aware that you are closely watching your content for theft, and will indeed think twice about stealing your content, at least without attaching some sort of source attribution. In any case, such a plugin is in high demand for people trying to cut down on "duplicate content" penalties on search engines that are ironically taken against their very own website, even though they are the original authors of said content.
